## Overview

This project is a simple QR code component, where the goal was to replicate the given design as closely as possible. The component is styled using Flexbox to ensure that it looks great on all devices, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Challenge

Your challenge was to build out a QR code component and make it look as close to the design as possible. Here's a quick summary of the objectives:

- Match the design exactly, including spacing, colors, and typography.
- Ensure that the component is responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- Utilize semantic HTML to ensure accessibility.

## Design Files

The challenge provides Figma design files, including layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop. The assets and design system include:

- Colors, typography, and spacing guidelines
- Optimized images for the QR code
- Design system documentation

## My Approach

In building this project, I followed these steps:

1. **Semantic HTML Structure**: I structured the page using semantic HTML5 elements to ensure that the component is accessible.
2. **CSS Flexbox for Layout**: The Flexbox layout model was used to achieve the design while maintaining responsiveness across different screen sizes.
3. **Design Fidelity**: Paying close attention to details such as padding, margins, and font sizes to ensure the design matches as closely as possible.
4. **Responsive Design**: Media queries were used to adapt the layout to different screen sizes. The component should look great on mobile (375px) as well as desktop (1440px) views.

## Built With

- HTML5 for semantic markup
- CSS3 for styling and layout
- Flexbox for responsiveness
